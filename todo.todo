☐ Fill database with questions and answers
☐ On first load of page retrieve a random question from the database to display. Add the id of question to prevSeen array
☐ When the user takes a guess inform the user whether they were right or wrong with a nice displayed message
☐ Decide whether to let the user answer the same question again if they get it wrong - or move onto a new question
☐ When the user gets it right, retrieve a new random question from the database (add this id to prevSeen array)
☐ Maybe implement a simple score system to let the user keep track of how many they have answered correctly this session
